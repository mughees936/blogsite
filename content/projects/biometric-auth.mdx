I built an advanced biometric authentication system that utilizes AI to verify user identities. The system was integrated into a web application using Elixir and LiveView, providing a secure and seamless login experience.

Results:
- Reduced login times by 50%.
- Increased security compliance.
- Showcased the integration of AI models with functional programming web frameworks.
