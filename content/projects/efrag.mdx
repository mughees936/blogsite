I led the development of an MVP to streamline EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group) reporting. The tool simplified the complex process of generating and managing financial reports, significantly reducing the time and effort required for compliance.

Achievements:
- Delivered the MVP within a strict 90-day deadline.
- Improved development efficiency by 30% through streamlined processes.
- Built Docker-based CI/CD pipelines to accelerate releases.
