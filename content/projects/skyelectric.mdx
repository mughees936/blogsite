At SkyElectric, I worked on a cross-functional team to enhance the fleet management system. This project involved integrating hardware telemetry with software control systems to optimize the performance and maintenance of solar energy solutions.

Key contributions:
- Implemented mTLS authentication for IoT devices.
- Developed scripts for shadow and dust detection to increase solar panel efficiency.
- Upgraded core system components to improve stability and observability.
