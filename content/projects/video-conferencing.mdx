At InvoZone, I developed a proprietary video conferencing solution to replace expensive third-party SDKs. This solution leveraged Elixir and Phoenix to provide real-time audio and video communication with high reliability and low latency.

Impact:
- Reduced operational costs by 60%.
- Improved internal communication efficiency by 35%.
- Demonstrated the power of Elixir for real-time applications.
